## Overview

The assignment's main objective was to create an enhanced and interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and some advanced CSS concepts like animations, transitions, CSS Grid, custom fonts, and dark-light mode.

## Intermediate Features

1. **Custom font:** I added Noto-Sans custom font to the website using `@font-face`. 

2. **Text-shadow on title text:** I styled the `<h1>` title text `text-shadow`, giving it a peachypuff neon appearance.

3. **Responsive background image:** I set the responsive background image using the CSS `contain` property. The image is overlaid with a 50% opacity black overlay to ensure the text remains clear and readable.

4. **Responsive Images:** I made the images in the `<h2>Photos</h2>` section responsive and put them in the HTML & CSS only image carousel.

5. **CSS Grid:** I replaced the CSS Flexbox in the .album-gallery with CSS Grid. The asymmetrical grid structure has also been implemented in the #Videos, #Trivia, #Photos, and #Concert-Ticket-Purchase-Form sections.

6. **Advanced form elements:** The #Concert-Ticket-Purchase-Form section has been enhanced with advanced form elements such as a date, colour picker, and age range picker.

7. **CSS animations and transitions:** I added simple animations and transitions to the `<h1>` title text. I also made the images in the #Albums section grayscale by default and only have colours when hovered over.

## Advanced Features

1. **High SEO rating:** This webpage got (a 92 score)[https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?psiurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwhimsical-salamander-e8c820.netlify.app%2F&strategy=mobile&category=performance&category=accessibility&category=best-practices&category=seo&category=pwa&utm_source=lh-chrome-ext] on Google Lighthouse.

2. **Dark and Light modes:** The webpage supports both dark and light modes, improving the user experience based on their preferences. The user's mode preference is saved and persists across refreshes.

3. **HTML & CSS only image carousel:** I implemented an image carousel  in the #Photos section without using JavaScript; I used the CSS's @keyframe for this.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Dark and Light mode:** Use the toggle switch in the web page's header to switch between dark and light modes. The preference will be saved and applied for future visits.

2. **Image carousel:** The carousel containing eight images will alternate automatically in 32s total.

3. **Concert Ticket Purchase Form:** Fill out the form located in the #Concert-Ticket-Purchase-Form section to book concert tickets. The form contains advanced input fields such as date selection, colour picker, and age range selection.

### Deployment

The webpage is deployed to https://whimsical-salamander-e8c820.netlify.app/.
